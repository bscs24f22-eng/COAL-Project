🚗 Car Rental System (MASM32 Assembly)

A menu-driven Car Rental Management System developed using MASM32 Assembly Language.
This project demonstrates low-level programming concepts by implementing a real-world application using x86 assembly and Windows API functions.

📌 Project Overview

This project is part of the CSC-241: 

Computer Organization and Assembly Language course at Namal University, Mianwali.

Unlike high-level languages, this system is built entirely in assembly language, providing direct control over registers, memory, and program flow. The application allows users to rent cars, return cars, and view car availability through a console-based interface.
